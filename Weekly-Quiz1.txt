Question 1: 
Accept two integer numbers from a user and return their product and  if the product is greater than 1000, then return their sum.

Expected output:
Enter first number 10
Enter second number 20
The result is 200

Question 2: 
Given a range of first 10 numbers, Iterate from start number to the end number and print the sum of the current number and previous number.

Expected Output:
Printing current and previous number sum in a given range(10)
Current Number 0 Previous Number  0  Sum:  0
Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17

Question 3: 
Accept string from a user and display only those characters which are present at an even index number.
For example str = "pynative" so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’.

Expected Output:
Enter String  pynative
Orginal String is  pynative
Printing only even index chars
index[ 0 ] p
index[ 2 ] n
index[ 4 ] t
index[ 6 ] v

Question 4: 
Given a string and an integer number n, remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.
For example, removeChars("pynative", 4) so output must be tive. Note: n must be less than the length of the string.

Question 5: 
Given a list of numbers, Iterate it and print only those numbers which are divisible of 5.
Given list is  [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]

Expected output:
Given list is  [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]
Divisible of 5 in a list
10
20
55

Question 6: 
Given a list of numbers, return True if first and last number of a list is same.
Given list is  [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
Given list is  [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Expected Output:
Given list is  [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
result is True
Given list is  [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
result is False

Question 7: 
Return the total count of string “Emma” appears in the given string.
Given string is “Emma is good developer. Emma is a writer”

Expected Output:
Emma appeared 2 times

Question 8:
Print the following pattern

1 
2 2 
3 3 3 
4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 5

Question 9: 
Reverse a given number and return true if it is the same as the original number.
numbers - 121,125

Expected Output:

original number 121
The original and reverse number is the same: True
original number 125
The original and reverse number is the same: False
True

Question 10: Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.
First List  [10, 20, 23, 11, 17]
Second List  [13, 43, 24, 36, 12]

Expected Output:

First List  [10, 20, 23, 11, 17]
Second List  [13, 43, 24, 36, 12]
result List is [23, 11, 17, 24, 36, 12]
